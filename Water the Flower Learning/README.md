#Water the Flower Learning

Water the flower is a simple game made using p5.js. 

###Game Rules 
The bot has two actions. Left, right. Score is reduced if the bot diverges from the nearest flower. If it takes correct turn decision, the flower gets watered and is removed from the queue.

 Using neuroevolution, the bot learns to play the game after certain 	number of generations. Made using pure javascript.

###Output

In the first generation, we see it has taken one wrong turn and it corrects itself from the second generation onwards.
